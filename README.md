# Program to analyze *.*bin file - In progress

<br>
<p>First version of the code: converting *.*txt to *.*bin. I know there is a lot of code on the web, but most of it doesn't work, or there are problems (not all), or there are pages of hopeless quality, because either there are limits of 5mb, or a lot of ads to block. 

This is the first version, I generally plan to make a free app and put it on the web. The immediate plan is to convert *.*log (including ArduPilot) and NMEA for GPS. 

Currently, the code can be used in many ways, but in general:
translates in ASCII txt to bin and displays tex in console, the goal is not to display txt in console (that can be done easily), but the goal is to display bin file. (The txt is just a test, but can also be used). You can replace the bin file with your own file. You can also translate txt to bin and download it for another job, etc.... 

You can do whatever you want with the code, but I will be grateful for tips, comments, and if someone pastes an asterisk on GitHub in the future, I won't be angry either :).
